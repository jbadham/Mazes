The model consists of a grid of square cells that are either live (also referred to as on) or dead (off). Each cell updates its based entirely on the count of live and dead cells in its neighbourhood. Such models are a specific implementation of cellular automata.
These models were made famous as Conway's Game of Life. This implementation extends the original Game of Life by allowing different rule sets (concerning the number of live neighbours) and probabilistic birth or death.
